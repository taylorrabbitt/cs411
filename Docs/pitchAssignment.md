### Idea #1 - Travel App
We are interested in creating an app that recommends travel itineraries based on a user's preference and budget. The app will use current flight prices, hotel prices, and local events/activities to give the user a vacation itinerary that fits in with their budget and vacation needs. 

### Idea #2 - Product Review App
As a back up idea, we are also interested in creating an app where a user can take a picture of a product and get reviews instantly from Amazon and other online marketplaces to help the user decide whether or not they should buy the product. For example, a user could take a picture of a book and recieve reviews from Amazon, Goodreads, and other book sellers to determine if they should purchase the book. 

### Idea #3 - Microlearning App
We have also discussed a third idea for an app that allows a user to set up a profile of topics that they would like to learn more about. Once their profile is created, the app will pull from different data sources to provide the user with new information on the topic every day.
