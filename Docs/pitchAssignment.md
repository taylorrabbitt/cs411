### Idea #1 - Travel App
We are interested in creating an app that recommends travel itineraries based on a user's preference and budget. The idea is that a user will create a profile of places they would like to visit, and the app will display any flights and itineraries within a user specified time range where the cost of the itinerary is cheap. Similar to a dedicated web application for flight price alerts. The web app will rather flight costs from various popular vendors and send the user to the website with the cheapest ticket for purchasing.

### Idea #2 - Product Review App
As a back up idea, we are also interested in creating an app where a user can take a picture of a product and get reviews instantly from Amazon and other online marketplaces to help the user decide whether or not they should buy the product. For example, a user could take a picture of a book and recieve reviews from Amazon, Goodreads, and other book sellers to determine if they should purchase the book. 

### Idea #3 - Microlearning App
We have also discussed a third idea for an app that allows a user to set up a profile of topics that they would like to learn more about. Once their profile is created, the app will pull from different data sources to provide the user with new information on the topic every day.
