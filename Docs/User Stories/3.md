As I am planning a vacation with a budget, not just an airplane ticket (see user story #1), I want to know how much my vacation will cost. The website fortunately takes care of that for me, giving me a cost estimate on decent accomodations. It also takes into account my food budget, giving me a trip within the budget range with everything taken into consideration. However I also may only want to search for flights, so I can turn the additional parameters off at any time.
