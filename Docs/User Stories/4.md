As I've been logged into the acount that I registered (see story 5), I should be able to create my own preference and wish lists, adding any locations I wish to travel to, any time frames that I think I will be available, and any activities and events that I want to see. After saving my preferences, I would like to get matching results or itineraries based on my preferences stored information. This should avoid me from manually using the first three stories (see story 1, 2, and 3) to search for prices of hotels, flights, and activities separately each time I log in. If no satisfing results were found (see story 2), I want to get notified every week about if a new result for that destination fitting my contraints have appeared,so I don't need to login in and track prices each day manually.
