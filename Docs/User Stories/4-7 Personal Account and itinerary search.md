As a customer, I need to be able to register and then login into my personal account.
After saving my preferences, I would like to get matching results or itineraries based on my preferences stored information. This should avoid me from manually using the first three stories to search for prices of hotels, flights, and activities separately each time I log in. If no satisfing results were found (see stroy 2), I want to get notified every week about if a new result for that destination fitting my contraints have appeared, so I don't need to login in and track prices each day manually.
