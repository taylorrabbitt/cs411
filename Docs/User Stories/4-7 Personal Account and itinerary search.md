4. App should have registration and login where user can add travel preferences (locations they would want to go, dates, things they like to do etc)

Edit-vyc: 
4. As a customer, I need to be able to register and then login into my personal account. 
5. After logging into my account, as a user I need to be able to select, save, and view my personal traveling preferences, including diffeerent locations that I would like to go, my budgets for each locations, times that I am available for trips, and things I would like to do.
6. After saving my preferences, I would like to get matching results or itineraries based on my preferences stored information. This should avoid me from manually using the first three stories to search for prices of hotels, flights, and activities separately.
7. If no satisfied results found in story 6, I want to get notified twice a week about if there are matching results found, so I don't need to login in and track prices each day manually.
