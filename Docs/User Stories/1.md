# User Story #1 - Flights based on budget and dates

I decide that I would like to take 2 weeks off of work sometime within the next two months but I am too lazy to look at all the available flights to all the places I may want to go to. I know that I have a certain budget and a few places in mind. I register and log into my user account (see user story #5) and see the main page. Within the main page, I create a profile with a few places that I wouldn't mind visiting, and note that I'd like to go somewhere within the next two weeks. I enter my budget of $1000 and the fact that I want a 2 week vacation. Everything is updated and the website displays some options. The options displayed are round trip flights that take me to the places I've entered and back within my time range. There are multiple options. I click on one and it takes me to the vendor's site.
