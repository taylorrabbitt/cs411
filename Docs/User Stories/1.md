# User Story #1 - Flights based on budget and dates

As a logged-in user (see user story #4), I should be able to change my budget and date range and receieve different flight options that fit within my current budget and specified dates. If no flights are available within my budget/date range, I should see an notification that no flights fall within my preferences and be able to click a button to change my preferences if desired.
