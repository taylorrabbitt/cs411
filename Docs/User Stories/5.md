So after I got to the front page of the app, skimmed through the apps features, and found they are useful to me, I want to have a way to register an account in order to use the app features (See stories 1-4 for the features). I want to have an email referenced to my account so whenever I loose my password I can use my email to authenticate me and let me change my password. When possible matchings found (see story 4), I also want to have notifications sent to the email I refenrenced to my account.
